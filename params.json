Select the \"Microjet\" aircraft in the upper-left A/C combo box.\r\n  Select \"sim\" from upper-middle \"target\" combo box. Click \"Build\".\r\n  When the compilation is finished, select \"Simulation\" from\r\n  the upper-right session combo box and click \"Execute\".\r\n\r\n4. In the GCS, wait about 10s for the aircraft to be in the \"Holding point\" navigation block.\r\n  Switch to the \"Takeoff\" block (lower-left blue airway button in the strip).\r\n  Takeoff with the green launch button.\r\n\r\nUploading of the embedded software\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Power the flight controller board while it is connected to the PC with the USB cable.\r\n\r\n2. From the Paparazzi center, select the \"ap\" target, and click \"Upload\".\r\n\r\n\r\nFlight\r\n------\r\n\r\n1.  From the Paparazzi Center, select the flight session and ... do the same as in simulation !","name":"Paparazzi UAS","google":""}
